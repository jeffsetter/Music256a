# Homework 1

This app creates several sine oscillators that are additively combined to produce a final sound. In the MainComponent.cpp file, there is a definition of the number of sine waves that are used on each side. A balance slider controls the relative gain between the left and right frequencies, while the gain of each sine wave controls the gain for the group of frequencies on its side.
