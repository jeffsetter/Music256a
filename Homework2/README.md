# Homework 2

This app iterates through random 2-note chords. The application provides an interface to adjust the center frequency, duration of the chord, as well as the spread of bottom note's frequency using the left sliders. In addition, sliders are provided for the gain and reverb. Fuast was used in order to create two sine waves that are averaged together before going through a zita filter. The Faust code was then compiled to C++ and placed in a Juce project.
