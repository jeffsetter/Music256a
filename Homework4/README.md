# Homework 4

This app simulates a rollercoaster using openframeworks. The graphic objects are a first-person POV on a rollercoaster track, and in the environment are clouds, grass, water, seagulls, and trees. Each of these objects creates sounds depending on their distance from the user in the rollercoaster.

The user is able to use the 4,6,8,2,5 buttons to control left,right,up,down,straight. These controls deform the rollercoaster rails to denote which direction is pressed, and also affect the panning/volume. One final amount of control is the +,- keys which control speed.
